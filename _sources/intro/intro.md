I like working with money. It's not my day job, but I enjoy it more than the average Joe. I understand how bonds work (and not the 007 variety... that will forever remain a mystery), I can describe the inner workings of Bitcoin, I have a firm grasp of index funds. In general, when I enter the financial world, I feel like I've got a pretty good start.

And you know what? Every time I read an article, I still feel like an idiot.

It's not hard to find articles that tell me that I'm not alone. Millennials who aren't sure how to start investing. Baby Boomers who don't have enough to retire. Amateur day traders who lose everything in one market or another. The average family's debt rising and savings falling. And still, the advice I see handed around varies from the cryptic to the foolish to the downright fraudulent.

If you want to maximize your credit card rewards or find advice about how to pick the best stocks, you've come to the wrong place. If you think you can game the system or want to play inside baseball, there are plenty of other blogs for you.

Do you feel like you've been spun around and set free in a minefield of financial advice? Do you feel like the game is rigged to trick you into losing everything? Do you feel hopelessly stuck and unable to pursue, or even set, financial goals? You've come to the right place.

I'm not from the government. And I'm not here to help. I'm here to teach you to help yourself. I'm here to get you to a spot where you feel in control and competent to either set out on your own or choose advisors to walk with you.

The Easy Dollar is not a typical blog (at least, not yet). There won't be new posts each week, and I won't ask you to subscribe. I'm going to put the information on here that I think everyone needs to know, and add to it or update articles only when I think it's needed. Consider this a reference to guide you into the world of managing your finances. I will link you to sources I trust, and at every turn I'll try to share with you _why_ I trust them. I'll point out trends that I recommend avoiding, and _why_ I think you should. And in the end, my goal is for you to leave both competent and confident to choose the best path for yourself and your family.
