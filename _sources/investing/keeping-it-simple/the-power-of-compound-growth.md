# The Power of Compound Growth

This topic has been written on a million times in a million places. I include my own version here because this site would be utterly incomplete without it. Maybe I'll even explain things in a way that finally makes sense to someone, or that helps you build a richer intuition around this topic.

## Interest

Interest is the money that a borrower pays to a lender as the price of borrowing money, on top of paying back the actual amount owed. (We'll talk more about personal debt elsewhere.) Colloquially, the word "interest" can also refer to other income generated from the investment of money. Technically, bonds (you loaning money to big companies) pay interest, stocks pay dividends, and assets that increase in value create capital gains. These differences are not insignificant, especially on your tax forms, but allow me, for the purposes of this article, to refer to them all as "interest".

Interest is almost always discussed in units of percentage gain per year (APY). If your investments pay you 10% of their value after a year has passed, that's a 10% APY, or I'll simply say a 10% return or yield (even though ROI technically means something different). Or let's say instead that, each month, your investments pay you 1%. To convert that to annualized return, we multiply by 12 to get a 12% return. Using annual returns makes everything easier to explain and compare (though it can obscure the volatility involved). For example, in the two cases above, you can see that the second investment generates money slightly faster.

Let's set some expectations:

- On debts you pay (again, see the article on the value of getting out of debt, coming soon):
    - Home mortgages often cost you ~4-6%
    - Car loans are ~4%
    - Credit cards can often be anywhere between 15-25% interest (or even a wider interval)
- On investments you make:
    - Stocks (using a broad index, not individual stock-picking) yield around 8-12% (**as a long-term average**, any individual year is generally between -11% to +33%)
    - Bonds (same caveat) yield around 4-6%
    - Investment real estate is really tricky to quantify, but I've seen estimates ranging from 4% to 10% depending on how you go about it
- Inflation: typically 2-4%

Inflation is an oddball here, but it's critically important to understanding how much wealth you're actually building. (I have a much more in-depth discussion of inflation and its source, coming soon.) Most of the time, I'll discuss returns without adjusting for inflation, since it's easier and eliminates yet another source of uncertainty, but the reality is that the US dollar is designed to lose value over time. If you want to adjust for inflation yourself, simply subtract the inflation rate (2-4%) from whatever APY we're discussing. For example, we might say that stocks yield 8-12% before inflation, and more like 5-9% after inflation. Some investments, like stocks, might be somewhat immune to inflation (meaning their value will likely increase more when inflation is higher) since their value is detached from the dollar, whereas others, like bonds, have values tightly tied to dollars.

Anyway, you can see that many investments range around 5-10% returns. That may seem very low. It can be made worse by volatility. But stick around, it gets better.

## Volatility

While most _debts_ that you can take on have a constant, fixed interest rate (though there are variable-rate loans), almost no _investments_ produce constant returns. (Annuities seem like an exception, but they function under the hood by investing in volatile investments and then flattening that out for you, for a fee.) While the percentages I gave above are good long-term estimates, not only will you see a great deal of variability year-to-year, but if you're actively drawing income from your investments, then that volatility is working against you.

Here's what's going on. Let's say you invest \$1,000 in an all-stock index fund. While history tells us that you can expect a steady 8-12% return _in the long run_, it may do anything between -11% and +33% in a given, typical year ([here's an awesome calculator for exploring this concept](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-historical-return-calculator/)). Those returns average out to 8-12% if you can leave your money invested, but what happens if you start pulling your money out?

Let's say you have a mediocre year, and your \$1,000 in stocks drops to \$900 (-10%). You have a minor car emergency (though note that this scenario is exactly the kind of thing an all-cash emergency fund helps you avoid, coming soon), and decide to pull \$100 out of stocks. You now have \$800 invested.

The next year is great, with +30% returns. \$800 \* 1.3 = \$1,040. In two years, you've gained a return of \$40, or \$20/yr, or 2% on average.

Let's try that again, but let's say you kept \$100 out in case of emergencies in advance, and only invested \$900. You still have a -10% year, but when you need the \$100, you have it lying around in cash and can leave your investments untouched. Thus, the value goes from \$900 to \$810 (-10%), and then up 30% to \$1,053. Now you've made \$153 in two years, \$76.5/yr, or \$76.5 / \$900 = 8.5% per year on average. Wow! That's a lot better. But is that really fair? Wasn't the \$100 you set aside in cash still money that could've been invested? Perhaps. Let's be fair and talk about the investment return of the entire original \$1,000, even though you held \$100 of it out. By that definition, you still ended up with a \$53 gain after two years, or \$26.5 per year, or an average of 2.65%.

Let's try one more scenario. Let's say we get lucky, investing our whole \$1,000 and encountering our emergency when it's up in value. So we put in \$1,000, lose -10% the first year for a value of \$900, then go up 30% the next year, for a value of \$900 \* 1.3 = \$1,170. We then have our car emergency, sell \$100 of stocks, and end up with \$1,070. That's an average of \$35/yr, or 3.5%. Even more than before!

Ideally, of course, it would be nice to leave _all_ the money invested and keep the \$1,170. However, if we do that at the expense of having sufficient cash reserves to _keep_ that money invested when life comes knocking, then we're at the whims of fate. At that point, we're gambling, because we don't know when the car transmission will go out or our home water heater will fail. We're just hoping it occurs on high years. By keeping some cash out to protect us from touching our investments, we increase our chances of higher, stable returns. (How much cash? See the overview of personal finances, coming soon.)

Before we move on, it's worth noting that this situation can work to our advantage as well. Money _invested_ during the low periods will produce more profits than money invested during the high periods. That said, money invested _sooner_ is almost always better than money invested _later_, so trying to time the market by holding money out and waiting for a valley is, again, gambling and likely to get you into trouble. Historically, trying to time the market isn't worth it, just invest money and then don't touch it.

## Compounding

"Compound growth" refers to the investment returns earned on previous investment returns. If that sounds recursive, like money-ception, that's because it totally is, and that's what makes it amazing.

Even 10% interest isn't all that exciting. If you invested \$10,000 at 10%, you'd earn \$1,000 each year, on average, for the rest of your life. Nice, but... is it really worth not having that \$10,000 to buy a car, or a TV, or help send a kid to college? And is \$1,000 worth the stress of rolling with the ups and downs of a volatile market? In 10 years, you'd have earned an extra \$10,000, then in another 10 years you'd earn another \$10,000, and so on... I mean, it's free money, but is that really worth it?

![](./images/compound-interest-01-1.png)

Here's where compounding comes in. Let's say, instead of taking your \$1,000 of free money each year, you re-invest it. So after one year, you have \$11,000 invested. 10% of that is \$1,100, which you reinvest again for a total of \$12,100. 10% of that is \$1,210, which you reinvest again for a total of \$13,310.

![](./images/compound-interest-02.png)

Ok, so you earn a little bit more each year, big woop, right? Here's what happens, though. That "little bit more" means you'll have doubled your initial investment, from \$10,000 to \$20,000, after 7 years rather than 10. Ok... three years' difference, so what?

Well, let's say you keep that \$20,000 invested. By the same logic, that'll double in another 7 years. Now you have \$40,000. Does that sound more interesting? If you're enjoying watching that number grow, maybe you'll sit on it a bit longer. In another 7 years it's \$80,000, and in another 7 years, it's \$160,000. All without you putting any more money in.

![](./images/compound-interest-03.png)

Now, all these 7 year intervals might seem like a long time. But let's say you start investing for retirement right out of college. You get a job at age 22 and retire, let's say, at age 65. That's 43 years (approximately 6 periods of 7 years). That is, money you invest while you're 22 will have doubled 6 times by the time you retire. 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 \* 2 = 64, so every \$1,000 you can get into the stock market at age 22 will be worth \$64,000 in retirement. If you can get \$10,000 in stocks at age 22, you'll have \$640,000 in retirement, _even if you never put another penny in for the rest of your life_.

![](./images/compound-interest-04-2.png)

Phew, that's not so shabby... but most 22 year olds don't have \$10,000 in spare cash lying around, so let's consider a realistic scenario, and let's use a real investment calculator to run the numbers ([option 1](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/investment-calculator), [option 2](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/investment-goal-calculator.aspx)). You're 22, coming out of college. You start saving \$100 a month (\$1,200 a year) for retirement in a [Roth account](roth-vs-traditional) (which just means you'll owe no taxes in retirement). If that grows at 10%, on average, and you keep that going until you're 65, you can expect to have ~\$1,050,000 by then, of which a mere 5% will be the money you put in, and the other 95% will be from interest.

![](./images/compound-interest-05-1.png)

Now, this isn't an article on retirement investing ([find that here](retirement-investing)), it's a discussion of compound interest. The point is that interest, when compounded, grows exponentially over time rather than linearly. A good rule of thumb is the "[rule of 72](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp)", which allows you to estimate the doubling time of an investment as 72 divided by the annual return. So if you have stocks yielding 10%, then 72 / 10 = ~7, so approximately every 7 years, expect the invested amount to double (assuming you don't put any more money in or take any out). If you have bonds yielding 5%, then 72 / 5 = ~14, so expect the investments to double in value every 14 years. Conversely, if inflation is 2% on average, then expect money to _lose_ half its value every 72 / 2 = 36 years.

Another handy trick in estimating the results of your investments is that each dollar is essentially independent. Let's say you invest \$1,000 in the year 2000, then another \$1,000 in the year 2002, then the first would have doubled by 2007 and the second would have doubled in 2009. Whether they're invested in the same fund or in two different 10% funds doesn't matter, the sum total of your investment will remain the same. So your final investment, essentially, is the growth of each dollar you put in magnified exponentially by how long that dollar remained invested. There's no inherent benefit to putting all your money in one investment versus splitting it across several identical investments. Now, that's "ideally": the reality is that, given volatility, some years are better to start your investment and some years are worse. Again, however, you can't know which year is which until it's in the past, so getting money invested sooner is almost always better than investing it later.

## How do I compound my investments?

So this is all great in theory, but practically, how do you actually make this happen? Well, assuming you already have opened an investment account (here's my article on doing so if you haven't yet, coming soon), you're probably already doing this.

Most investments, when you make them, will either default to compounding or offer you an option such as "automatically reinvest dividends". Just make sure that anytime your investments generate income (not merely increase in value), that that income is used, as soon as possible, to purchase more of the same investments. Again, this is typically the default behavior in most mutual funds if you don't specifically request otherwise.
