<h1>What Are Stocks and Bonds<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-stocks-and-bonds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>You’ve heard of stocks, you might’ve heard of bonds. But what actually are they, how do they work, how do they interact, and why does everybody want them?</p>
<p>I’ll preface this discussion by saying that my goal isn’t to be 100% accurate with the technical lingo. My goal is to explain things sufficiently that anyone can understand them. If you want to dive deeper into how stocks and bonds function, there are many great resources you can find.</p>
<section id="stocks">
<h2>Stocks<a class="headerlink" href="#stocks" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When a company becomes publicly traded, its ownership is ripped into millions of tiny pieces and scattered across the market. These fragments are called stocks. Technically, each stock comes with a vote on the company’s most important decisions; practically, usually one person or a small group of people own the majority of the shares and make all decisions, so for the rest of us, it’s just a way of holding some of the company’s value.</p>
<p>Ok, so a stock represents a very small piece of ownership of the company. That means that, in theory, the value of all the shares of stock should represent the total value of the company. When they buy new equipment, make more profit, enter new markets, yada yada yada, they become more valuable. The technical terms are assets and liabilities (line items of positive and negative value).</p>
<p>But knowing what that value is at any given moment is very hard. For example, what if the company is planning to release a big new product next week, but they haven’t told anyone yet? What is their value? And how can that be known by the public shareholders trading their stock shares? Or what if a company is currently on hard times, but just got a new CEO who’s likely to turn things around. Is the company more valuable now, or do they only become more valuable once they actually start doing new things?</p>
<p>The reality is that shares are as valuable as the people buying them think they are. (Really, this is true of <a class="reference internal" href="../digging-deeper/what-is-money.html#what-is-money"><span class="std std-ref">anything money can buy</span></a>…) That has some anchor to reality, since in theory the shareholders could all liquidate the company, sell off all their assets, and turn the whole thing back into cash. This kinda happens when a company goes bankrupt and liquidates their assets, but by that point the money just goes to whoever the company owed money to, and shareholders are left with nothing.</p>
<p>So stocks represent a small share of a company, they tend to cost whatever the company’s net worth is divided by the number of shares, but often they fluctuate in value depending on how much people <em>expect</em> the company to be worth.</p>
<p>If you can guess correctly when a company is going to increase in value (real or expected), buy when they’re cheaper and sell when they’re more expensive, then you make money.</p>
<p>Voila, stocks.</p>
<p>By the way, before I move on, don’t play this game. Trading individual stocks with the hope of making profit is called Day Trading, and <a class="reference external" href="https://marklyck.medium.com/why-80-of-day-traders-lose-money-78d51b10fe25">most people who try it lose money</a>. Really, it’s no wonder when you learn how big investment firms play this game. Even those who make money often earn less than what you’d earn by investing in other ways. Don’t read the story of the rare people who make it rich day-trading; someone wins the jackpot at the casino, and someone wins the lottery, but on average it’s guaranteed to be a losing game.</p>
<p>One last thing: dividends. Normally, if you own a company, you can choose to take money out of it when you want to pay yourself. If you’re the sole owner, you get those profits. For a publicly traded company, this occurs through dividends. Periodically (it depends on the company, maybe monthly, quarterly, or annually), the company can choose to divide up its spare profits into “paychecks” to its owners. When this occurs, the total profits are divided up by the number of stocks, and each shareholder is paid according to how many shares they own: this payment is called a <strong>dividend</strong>. Some companies do this regularly, some do it rarely if ever, it depends on a whole lot of factors.</p>
</section>
<section id="bonds">
<h2>Bonds<a class="headerlink" href="#bonds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Ok, so if stocks are small bits of ownership of a company, what’s a bond?</p>
<p>Pretend you’re a big company for a moment. You have a great new idea, but it’ll take $10M to get it off the ground. You could wait until you can save enough of your profits to pay for it, or you could take out a loan and hope that you’ll make more profit than you’ll pay in interest. You expect this venture to pay for itself within 5 years.</p>
<p>But where do you find someone who will lend you that much money? And even if someone will, do you really want to be beholden to one entity for so much money?</p>
<p>Instead, you shatter your desired debt into little pieces, say $1,000 each. If you want $10M, you create 10,000 pieces of debt; whoever buys a piece of debt, you promise to pay them 3% interest ($30/yr) for 5 years, at which point you’ll give them their $1,000 back. Each of these pieces of debt is called a Bond.</p>
<p>Though the bond costs a flat amount to purchase originally (in this case, $1,000), there are a couple factors at play in determining the value of a bond if you want to sell it off partway through.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The principal. The bond is worth $1,000 after 5 years. (Note that this means it’s worth slightly less than $1,000 at any given moment due to “opportunity cost”, and slowly the principal value of the bond rises to $1,000 as you get closer to the due date for repayment.)</p></li>
<li><p>The interest. The bond is worth $30/yr for 5 years. That’s $150 total, though some of it you’ll get now, some of it you’ll get later. (Again, opportunity cost complicates that number.) As time passes, more of these interest payments get made out, and there’s less interest left to be paid on a given bond.</p></li>
<li><p>The risk. What if the company ceases to exist in 3 years? Then you’ll have made $90 from the first three years’ interest, but you’ll never get your $1,000 back. This is causes the bond to be “discounted”, meaning that even if there’s $1,150 to be paid out on the bond, it may only be worth $900 on the open market if there’s a good chance the company won’t be around to pay that money back.</p></li>
<li><p>The prevailing rates. Let’s say I buy a 3% 5-year bond this year. One year later, the company releases a new batch of 5-year bonds, but these ones have a 10% interest rate. Well, those cost $1,000 and will yield $500 of interest rather than $150. Even though there’s still $120 of interest left on my bond, meaning theoretically it’s worth $1,120, why would anyone pay me that much when they could pay $1,000 for a new bond and get $100/yr? The only advantage I have is that my bond will pay out its $1,000 a year sooner.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these considerations factor in to the bond market. If you simply buy and hold a bond until it “matures” (pays the principal back out), and if the company doesn’t go under, you get exactly what you paid for. If you want your money back sooner, though, or if your bond is suddenly worth more than originally expected for any of the reasons given above, you might want to sell it on the open market. For similar reasons, you might also want to buy a partially matured bond from the open market. In either of these cases, bond resale rates become a consideration.</p>
<p>Alright, nerd time over. Here’s the short and simple of it. Bonds don’t change in value nearly as much as stocks do, since they have a concrete cash value once they reach maturity. They do, however, pay out consistent interest payments. This makes them sources of steady income and stable investments overall. Investing in bonds is the primary way to counter-balance the risk (volatility) you take when you invest in stocks.</p>

<section id="funds-mutual-index-etc">
<h2>Funds (Mutual, Index, etc.)<a class="headerlink" href="#funds-mutual-index-etc" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>But which stocks should you buy? And which bonds? And if shouldn’t pick stocks, then how do you buy them? And how do you generate anything like a stable income from all of these things?</p>
<p>The answer is tremendously simple, and this is key. The simpler you keep your investments, the better you’ll do, for a huge variety of reasons. Ready for this?</p>
<p>Invest in everything, all at once.</p>
<p>Yup, that’s all you do.</p>
<p>How do you do that? When a single share of Tesla (or whatever the latest fad is) can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, how can you possibly invest in everything?</p>
<p>The answer is mutual funds (or index funds–they’re basically the same thing, just one is run by humans, who want to get paid for their efforts, and the other is mostly automatic and nearly free).</p>
<p>Funds are giant pools that you can buy into. If 10,000 people invest $10,000 each, then you suddenly have $100M to invest, and buying a little of everything becomes attainable. These funds are run by companies like Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and a bazillion others (though you don’t necessarily have to have an account with a company to buy their funds…), and are largely trustworthy, well-run, and have very intelligent people keeping them going.</p>
<p>A mutual fund will have a particular set of goals, which they’ll outline in some public document you can find and read. Maybe it’s focusing on buying stocks of companies they expect to grow in value; maybe it’s buying stocks with a strong track record of paying dividends; maybe it’s balancing both stocks and bonds to yield reliable income. Whatever the goal is, you can throw your tiny bit of money into their giant pot, and they’ll invest it for you for a very modest fee (generally something like 0.5% of your invested money each year). Index funds are basically the same thing, but automatically rebalance themselves across a collection (or index) of stocks rather than trying to pick stocks that human managers think will perform well. Either of these fund types will buy you stability, peace of mind, safety, and good returns, all achieved through <strong>diversification_._</strong></p>
<p>Why does diversification help? Here’s a simple example. Let’s say you own 1 share each of two stocks, A and B, and both are worth $10/share. A day passes, and now A is worth $15/share and B is worth $5/share. Your total money hasn’t changed, just your allocation (in dollars). You sell 0.33 shares ($5) of A and buy 1 share ($5) of B to bring your portfolio (your collection of investments) back into balance. The next day, the share prices return to $10/share for both stocks. Now you have 0.67 shares of A, worth $6.7, and 2 shares of B, worth $20. Your portfolio is worth $26.7, and congratulations, you’ve made money!</p>
<p>What just happened? The stock prices went back to where they were before, and yet you made money? Follow the math above and you’ll build an intuition for why this occurs. Of course, this all assumes that they <em>do</em> return to their original prices, and also that they fluctuate in different directions. If both stocks just go up and down together, your gains are just the average gains. I explore these concepts in a more technical discussion elsewhere (coming soon).</p>
<p>The more stocks you have, the more likely you can benefit from these kinds of fluctuations. For example, when a company like Tesla or Apple rises out of obscurity, they rise disproportionately more than the rest of the market, thus generating returns if your diversified portfolio owned some of them. So if that’s the case, why not buy everything? Well… actually, that’s exactly what you should do.</p>
<p>The advantages of leveraging this approach are subtle, and there are other advantages it ignores. For example, there really are some companies that are more likely to increase in value than others, and buying their stocks is more likely to increase your wealth. However, even trying to target particular sectors of the market is often riskier than just buying everything. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html">This is demonstrated by mutual funds (actively managed, or human-directed funds) consistently underperforming the market, which is matched by index funds (passively managed, or automatically-directed funds)</a>.</p>
<p>There’s all sorts of research and controversy into this topic (why people can’t beat the market), and it defies common intuition. I’m not going to hypothesize here. I’m just going to tell you that passive index funds 1) basically match the stock market as whole, 2) therefore beat most actively-managed funds, and 3) come with crazy low management fees, and 4) have a solid track record.</p>
<p>For reference, most stock market funds yield something like 8-12% per year <em>on average over a lot of years</em>. What do I mean by that? Let’s consider an example. Let’s say you invest in an index fund that invests you in the S&amp;P 500, the top 500 companies in the US market. (<a class="reference external" href="https://dqydj.com/sp-500-historical-return-calculator/">I’m using this handy calculator to get these values.</a>)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In 1 year, you could have made anywhere between +151% and -58%. In 80% of years, you’d make between -15% and +32%. Those are huge ranges, and demonstrate why you shouldn’t invest money you plan to need soon. However, notice that they’re biased above 0%: that means that, on average, you’d expect to make money.</p></li>
<li><p>In 5 years, the best period in history returned 33% and the worst gave -15%; both of those values are <em>per year</em>. In 80% of years, you’d expect to make anywhere between -3% and +18% per year. Notice how the values are much tighter than before: as you average over more years, we begin to see that the stock market becomes relatively stable.</p></li>
<li><p>In 10 years, the best return was 20% and the worst was -6% per year. In most years, you’d expect between -0.5% and +14%.</p></li>
<li><p>Over 30 years, never in the history of the S&amp;P 500 has that period yielded less than 2% growth per year, or more than 11%. Most of the time, that period yields a relatively stable 4.5-8.5%.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those interest values are lower than expected partly due to adjusting for inflation, which reduces the value of the dollar by 2-4% per year. Add 2-4% to those numbers, and you get the 8-12%, or approximately 10%, that is often reported as the S&amp;P 500 return.</p>
<p>Note that this stability increases both over time and when you’re more diversified. Also, note how stable these values are. Sometimes, people hear that investing in the stock market is gambling. <strong>Investing in single stocks is gambling. Investing in broadly diversified funds isn’t.</strong> That doesn’t mean it’s not volatile, but that, on average, you gain wealth.</p>

<section id="but-if-i-gain-money-someone-else-loses-it-right">
<h2>But if I gain money, someone else loses it, right?<a class="headerlink" href="#but-if-i-gain-money-someone-else-loses-it-right" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Here’s the difference between long-term index investing and short-term day trading.</p>
<p>If I buy a stock today and sell it tomorrow, the company’s true value hasn’t changed, only maybe people’s perception of that value. If I buy low and sell high, then whoever I bought the stock from lost that value gain, and whoever I sell the stock to pays for that gain with their cash. It’s a zero-sum game: the winners win at the expense of the losers (mostly).</p>
<p>So how can everyone who invests in index funds reap a positive return (even after inflation)? Why isn’t this gambling too? There are a couple ways to build an intuition for this.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A company can gain true value endlessly, there’s nothing stopping them from growing more than 100%, but they can only lose what value they have, 100%. Now, mathematically it’s not quite that simple, but that’s the general idea. Companies keep growing more and more valuable, producing more and more goods and wealth for the world. If you only have 1% of your money in a particular company, there’s no bound to how much that amount can grow, maybe doubling or tripling in value, but even if they fail completely, you only lose 1% of your overall investment.</p></li>
<li><p>Economically, value is created when people do work to bend reality into something more useful for someone else (which that that customer is willing to pay for). If I pay someone $100 to work for me for a day, and they make something that I can sell for $110, the $10 profit represents the increased utility in the universe of what that person did. Maybe they turned iron ore into steel, or steel into a hammer. Money can only circulate in circles, but as it does so, the world is made more useful for everyone (on average). It’s this slow and steady gain that’s represented as long-term profits in the ongoing increase of the entire stock market.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So the answer is that, in the long term, real value is really created. By owning shares of the companies creating that value, or by lending them money to accelerate that process, you can profit from that process. And best of all, those profits are truly “sustainable”: everyone can share in them, and that one person gaining wealth is not at the cost of someone else doing the same. By pooling our money together into giant, centrally managed funds, even those of us with very little to invest can reap the stable rewards of diversification.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-should-i-diversify">
<h2>How should I diversify?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-should-i-diversify" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>We understand the broad topic of stocks and bonds now, but once we get down to brass tacks, how much of my money should I put into each?</p>
<p>Look at the returns each group of investments has made over the past decade or two. You’ll see something like the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>US stocks make the highest return (8-12%), but have high volatility.</p></li>
<li><p>International stocks made a moderate return, depending on which nations you included, but not as high on average as the US market. These also have a high volatility, but it’s sometimes uncorrelated with US stock volatility, so it’s good to own both for reasons discussed earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Bonds make a lower return (think more like 3-6%), but have lower volatility than stocks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Many advisors will suggest a balance like 80/20% stocks/bonds as “aggressive” or 60/40% as “moderate” growth. <a class="reference external" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/model-portfolio-allocation">Here’s a great comparison from Vanguard of various ratios</a>, which (in my opinion) shows that you basically just need to choose “mostly stocks” or “mostly bonds”, and beyond that it’s pretty much pinching at pennies. For retirement investing, you’ll often hear advice about shifting this ratio to reduce risk as you approach retirement; I have a separate article on that (coming soon).</p>
<p>How you break up between US and international markets is up to you, but international stocks have had a rough couple of decades recently. The current advice seems to be to be mostly in US markets with a bit in international for diversification. That’s up to you. I personally think that US culture and law is still among the best in the world for fostering the creation of true wealth, which, as described above, I see as the root of the creation of long-term profits. I’m expecting US markets to outperform international markets long-term because of that, but I’m not an investment advisor and you should make your own decisions based on real data that you find for yourself.</p>
