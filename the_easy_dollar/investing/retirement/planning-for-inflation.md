# Planning for Inflation

Inflation is a controversial topic (see my discussion of [the Federal Reserve](the-federal-reserve), but the reality right now is that the US dollar is inflationary, as are most currencies around the world. That means that a dollar tomorrow isn't worth a dollar today, and that has implications for long-term saving and investing.

## What is inflation?

Do you remember when the dollar menu at McDonalds had more options? Or when Subway started the "\$5 Footlong" campaign? Or when gas cost less than \$2 per gallon (or, if you're from a generation prior to mine, \$1 per gallon)? Or have you watched an older movie where candy cost a penny and many goods cost a quarter? Whatever happened to all that? And why does everything keep getting more expensive?

The US Dollar (USD) is a man-made, unbacked currency (or "fiat currency"), meaning that there's no real limit to how many can exist and that there's no fixed asset that a dollar can be traded for (and no, merely fixing the price of gold in USD doesn't solve the problem). It derives value from the government accepting it for tax payment and because they'll throw you in prison if you refuse to accept it as payment from others. As such, it exists as a tradable commodity on the open market, and behaves like any other commodity, following the laws of supply and demand.

It may be easier to understand this concept by simply looking at other currencies around the world. Let's consider the Japanese Yen. In Japan, a new car costs something like ¥1,000,000 (I'm working on some loose data here, but just accept the order of magnitude and work with me here). Why so much? Well actually, that's pretty cheap, since ¥1,000,000 is equivalent to something like \$10,000, which is a bit cheaper than most new cars in the states. But why are a million Yen equivalent to 100x fewer US Dollars? Because there are more of Yen than Dollars in circulation. Goods and services are available in Japan just as plentifully as they are in the US, but there are 100x more Yen around than there are USD in an equivalent situation in the US. That means that people attach 100x less value to a Yen, and are willing to pay 100x more of them for the same good or service.

This trend shows up in every country, even ones with very similar economies. Goods and services are valued similarly relative to each other and to common people's wages (you'd expect a salary with a couple extra 0's in Japan if you were doing the same work), but the exact number of dollars, yen, or whatever that looks like in each country is arbitrary. If you doubled the number of US Dollars in circulation, the price of everything (in terms of dollars) would double too.

That is, the value of goods (cars, stocks, gold, TV's, etc.) remains relatively stationary, and the value of the currency in each country is different. A US Dollar is worth more than a Japanese Yen, not because it's superior in any way but because there are fewer of them around.

Ok, so the price, in US Dollars, of a car is determined not merely by the car and the buyer, but also by the relative value of the US Dollar against all the goods it can buy. If _either_ the relative value of the car goes up (say, it becomes a collectible) _or_ the value of the dollar goes down (more US Dollars enter circulation), then the price goes up.

What causes more US Dollars to enter circulation? [The Federal Reserve](the-federal-reserve), and government debt.

## How does inflation affect me?

So the US Dollar is a good, like any other good, and when there are more of them around, their value relative to other goods goes down.

And the Federal Reserve "prints" money and enables more of it to be put into circulation.

How much? [The Fed aims for about 2% per year](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/5D58E72F066A4DBDA80BBA659C55F774.htm), but I'd say a safe range would be [more like 2-4%](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi). For the purposes of this article, I'll stick with 2% so we have a single number to work with, but I'll use 2-4% in many other places on this site.

So every year, any cash you possess loses 2% of its value. Let's say, over the course of your life you saved money into a savings account, and have \$100,000 piled up (please don't do this!). This year, that'll buy you \$100,000 worth of goods. Next year, it'll buy what \$98,000 would have bought this year. After about 30 years, it'll only buy what \$50,000 would have bought today, even though you haven't touched it. Your balance will still say you have \$100,000, but the price of everything will have doubled.

This means that unless your money is invested in something earning more than 2% interest (a house, stocks/bonds, etc.), you're actually _losing_ wealth by having that cash. Remember that money itself does nothing for you, and is only valuable in terms of what you can buy with it. So if you can buy less with your money, then you have less wealth in terms of real goods.

Also, anything that's earning you interest is actually earning you 2% less value than it seems on face value. A bond with 3% interest is only gaining you 1% of value per year, since the cash it's paying you is worth 2% less each year.

This 2% subtraction from the effective return on any investment greatly increases the difference between stocks (8-12% before inflation, more like 6-10% after) and bonds (4-6% before inflation, more like 2-4% after). If we look at the returns before inflation, stocks appear to be about 2x better than bonds, but if we look at inflation-adjusted returns, they're more like 3x better.

I hope this makes you think twice before tolerating today's "savings account" interest rates of <1% (so really, -1-2% of value per year). If it's earning less than 2%, then it's not a savings account, it's a losing account.

## Inflation for Retirement Planning

When you're planning to save for retirement, the common exercise is:

- Look at your current income and the lifestyle that buys you
- Consider the lifestyle you want in retirement, **and the income you'll need to support that**
- Subtract any expected non-investment income, such as from pensions or social security
- Use [the 4% rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp) to estimate how much money you'll need in investments to generate the remaining desired income
- Given how long you have until retirement, your risk tolerance, your current savings, etc., how much do you need to be saving (per month or per year) to expect to have that amount in investments by retirement age?

Inflation kicks in at the second bullet: the income you'll need to support a given lifestyle needs to be adjusted for expected inflation.

I'm young, and have 30-40 years until I expect to hit "retirement age". If inflation is 2%, [then money loses half its value every 36 years](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp), so I'll need twice the income in retirement to support even the same lifestyle I have today. If I'm more pessimistic and expect a 3% inflation rate, then money loses half its value every 24 years, then I'll need more like 4x the income to support my current lifestyle. If I'm even more pessimistic and expect a 4-5% inflation rate, then I might need up to 8x my current income at that point to support my current lifestyle. It's not about my current or future lifestyle, it's purely about how much less a dollar will be worth in 40 years.

A common, super-simple rule of thumb for "how much do I need to save for retirement" that I've heard has been "\$1,000,000". Based on the 4% rule, \$1M could generate a stable income of \$40,000/yr. That's a seriously livable income that a person could survive on in many parts of the country, with money left over for some creature comforts if managed correctly (or a lot better if you're not paying off a house at that point).

That's fine advice for someone in their 40's or 50's with only a decade or two left until retirement, but for someone just starting out, in their 20's or 30's, that's equivalent to a \$20,000/yr income (or less) once we adjust for inflation. I mean, I wouldn't sniff at that money, and I'm sure a person could survive on that under the right circumstances (reasonably healthy, living in a cheaper region, have a mostly paid-for house), but that's pretty tight. For that younger generation, the equivalent that they should hear would be "\$2,000,000". It sounds like a lot of money now, but in 40 years, being a millionaire won't be such a big deal. On the bright side, [given the power of compound interest](the-power-of-compound-growth), achieving a lofty goal like that is much easier to achieve if you start young.

So in summary, inflation is a major player in long-term saving goals, the longer-term your horizon, the more it skews your numbers. Remember to account for this any time you work out your investment numbers and retirement goals.
