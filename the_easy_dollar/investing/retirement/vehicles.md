# 401Ks and the other things

If you've ever encountered the world of retirement, you've undoubtedly encountered a bewildering storm of acronyms and meaningless names. 401k's, 403b's, IRA, TSP, etc. I'll even briefly discuss 529's, HSA's, FSA's, and the like while we're here. I'll refer to them as "vehicles", since they are merely legal boxes in which ride the things you really want: investments.

Bottom line up front: for each group of vehicles, they simply serve a particular goal. I don't care much about the distinctions among the vehicles for a particular goal--I don't care about a 401k versus a 403b, or even versus an IRA. Some people will treat them as entirely different things and draw huge contrasts among them. Certainly, each vehicle is different, and there are numerous articles out there explaining the finest nuances if that's what you want. I, on the other hand, want to provide you a high-level intuition to allow you to reason about these things. For that goal, the distinctions among the vehicles are minor details.

## Retirement: 401k, 403b, IRA, TSP, ...

I'm familiar with at least four kinds of retirement vehicles: 401k's, 403b's, IRA's, and TSP's. Each of these is merely a set of legal codes around a single concept: allowing you to invest money tax-free for retirement. I say "tax-free", but you will pay income tax on either the money going in (Roth) or the money coming out (Traditional). Check out my [Roth v. Traditional](roth-vs-traditional) article for a deeper discussion--I'll use those terms freely below, so please at least skim it if you're not familiar with those terms.

For the sake of this conversation, it's just important to know that you can have a 401k, say, and then _within_ that you can have investments. 401k isn't a company, it's a legal code that creates a legal vehicle which various companies can offer you. I, for example, have a 403b with Vanguard. 403b's and 401k's are almost identical, the main difference being which kinds of companies can offer which. So my company is legally allowed to offer a 403b, then they partner with Vanguard to facilitate that for their employees. As one such employee, I can then ask my employer to invest some of my paycheck into that 403b, then go to Vanguard to manage that money (choosing how to invest it, primarily--for example, as a [1-fund portfolio](the-1-fund-portfolio)).

Why would I want to do this versus just getting the money and investing it normally? Because money invested within my 403b grows tax-free. The federal government defines what a 403b can be, defines limits (e.g., how much I can put in each year, or when I can withdraw money without penalty), and in exchange keeps its grubby hands off my money. They do this to incentivize people to save for retirement; that is, by lowering my tax burden if I do this thing that's good for my future, they motivate more people to plan for their future. (Coincidentally, see my discussion of the fed and why all taxes are social sculpting, coming soon.)

While I list at least four retirement vehicles, these group into essentially two groups of any importance: employer-sponsored and individual.

401k's, 403b's, and TSP's are all employer specific. I'm not an expert on them, but my impression is that 401k's are for for-profit companies, 403b's are for academic or non-profit organizations, and TSP's are for some federal employees. I'm sure there are many other such things (e.g., a 401a, which I'm much less familiar with). To find out which one you do or don't have access to, and whether you have only a Traditional offering or also a Roth option, check with your employer. Many employers also contribute some money to this fund if you do ("matching" your contribution), so there's often additional incentive to invest this way.

IRA's, on the other hand, are somewhat special. They stand for "Individual Retirement Account", and anyone can open one. It's entirely your own, and your employer has nothing to do with your eligibility for an IRA. Practically, the limits on how much you can put in each year are lower than for the other vehicles, but also you can (almost) always choose a Roth option if you wish. This makes them more flexible, but less valuable (due to lower annual investing limits). There's never a match for investing in an IRA and the limits are quite low, but it can be a good way to invest more, or differently, than is allowed by your employer plan.

A good rule of thumb ([following Ramsey's advice here](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/401k-vs-roth-ira)) is to aim for a total of 15% of your income to go toward retirement, breaking that up in the following priority order:

1. 401k (or equivalent) up to employer match. Roth is preferable but not necessary here, just don't pass up on free extra money if your employer offers a match.

3. Roth IRA, since this provides you maximum flexibility.

5. Roth 401k, if available to you.

7. Traditional 401k.

Between a 401k and an IRA, you won't hit the investment limits unless you're making a tremendous paycheck, like $150K/yr. or more. If you're married and both working, the limit's even higher since you can both have 401k's and IRA's.

Alright, now take a breath. This isn't a topic worth geeking out about. These vehicles are just various ways you might have to avoid paying taxes on investment growth (which is a really huge boost). Understand your options (and hire an advisor if needed), set your plan, get your money automatically investing itself, then move on with your life. This just isn't all that important.

## Kids' College: 529

529's are "college savings" vehicles. They're similar to the vehicles discussed above in that money inside of them grows tax-free. Instead of being intended for retirement, money inside a 529 is intended for educational needs, particularly college expenses. As such, you'd typically open one for your child instead of for yourself, but if you're planning on going back to school, you can probably open one for yourself too.

Again, there are all sorts of details about opening 529's for each of your kids, transferring money from one kid's 529 to another's, what the money can and can't be spent on, etc. If that's the information you're looking for, a quick google will find your answer.

The intuition to have about 529's is that they're good ways to save in advance for your child's future education. When they're born, open a 529 for them and start saving a little money into it. That doesn't need to pay their whole college tuition or anything, but the odds that you can use it to pay for _some_ educational benefit to your child are pretty good (or you can transfer it to another child who will benefit from it), and then the interest it will accrue while they're growing up will all be tax-free.

## Healthcare: HSA, FSA

HSA and FSA are two different ways of saving money for health-related expenses, which both offer tax advantages.

HSA's are like 401k's or 529's, but can be spent on medical expenses instead of retirement or college. Any money you put into the HSA is tax-deductible for that year: that means that you're taxed as if you hadn't earned that money. Practically, that means that money in an HSA is worth 20-30% more than money not in an HSA (or alternatively, that money in an HSA cut 20-30% of its value off your tax bill). Additionally, money inside an HSA can be invested and grow tax-free. Some people use this as a back-door retirement fund, but there's generally no need to get so fancy. HSA's, like IRA's, are _your_ money that you can invest as you please and spend under the right conditions.

Being legally allowed to open an HSA is a matter of what kind of health insurance you have. Again, I'll refer you to google and your employer to figure out if this is an option for you; if it is, it _can_ be a good way to put your money toward your health.

An FSA is fairly different: you allocate money going into a year, guessing at how much you'll need for medical expenses. During that year, you can then spend that money on those expenses. At the end of the year, the leftover money is typically lost, though different FSA plans may offer some grace period or a little roll-over. The money isn't invested or anything, but it is contributed to the FSA tax-free, so it still lowers your tax bill a little. It's a bit tricky, though, since you want to put as much money in as you will use to save as much taxes as possible, but also you don't want to waste unspent money... or more subtly, spend money you didn't need to spend. I think FSA's are pretty crappy deals, but they're worth it if you don't over-save into them.

Having an FSA is employer-dependent. Check your benefits package to see if this is a part of it.

## Summary

I really dislike these vehicles as a concept. I'd much rather the government just kept their hands off more of my money rather than creating these nuanced complications to try to sculpt my behavior. Unfortunately, that's not the world we live in. Given the tax landscape we actually have, it's worth figuring out what you have access to and how best to use these vehicles to keep as much of your own money as possible. In most cases, you'll have a fairly small set of options based on what your employer has chosen for you, so take advantage of what you have and try not to get bogged down in the nuances.
