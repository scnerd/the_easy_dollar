# Retirement Investing

While significant discussions will each receive their own article, there is some common groundwork worth discussing to set the discussion around retirement investing.

## What is retirement?

I define retirement as a stage of life where you're **financially independent**.

Being a **wage slave** means that you depend on a paycheck for basic sustenance, and that you earn that paycheck in exchange for your time. This is most people for most of our lives, and there's nothing shameful about being here. Frankly, in most times and places in the history of the world, most people were wage slaves, at best, for their entire lives.

The alternative is to be **financially independent**. This means that you derive income from sources other than in exchange for your time, and that income is sufficient to sustain your lifestyle. This income is often called passive income, and might come from investments, annuities, royalties, or many other sources. Passive income often has some volatility, so that's worth considering (maybe this year your investments made X dollars, but perhaps next year they won't).

The transition between these two is somewhat gradual. For example, having cash in a savings account that you can draw down may buy you a few months of financial independence between jobs. Or, you might have enough investments to support you if you decrease your lifestyle, but you'd need to save more if you wanted to avoid taking a "pay cut".

Note that this definition of retirement, "being financially independent", has no bearing on what you do with your time, nor does it have anything to do with your age (though your age does affect some things... we'll come back to that). If you have a job that you like that makes enough to live on, great! You don't need to stop doing that in "retirement" just because you're "retired". The only difference between being financially independent and being a wage slave is that you don't have to make enough money from a job to live on. If you depend on a paycheck, you're not free to not work: you'll lose your stuff, you'll starve, life will be bad. If you're financially free, then you can do what you like, whether that brings in an income (like a job you enjoy) or not (like volunteering or doing charity work).

## Can I ever be financially independent?

Yes. Yes you can. Whether you make barely above poverty level or are bringing in many hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, you can become financially independent and retire. When that occurs, what your lifestyle will look like, and what it will take you to get there may vary, but you can do it.

(I want to insert a caveat here. I'm aware there are exceptions. If you live life on a ventilator and have no ability to do anything, I'll set these expectations aside, offer charity, and let you decide what you seek to accomplish with your life. You still have value, don't ever let that go, but converting that into money may not be an option. If that's not you, if you're physically capable of doing economically profitable work, then you're not the exception I'm talking about, and you can do this if you set your life to it.)

How do I know you can do it? Because people from every walk of life do this every day. For inspiration, see [Debt-Free Screams](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/debt/top-debt-free-screams) or google around for people who achieve F.I.R.E. People at every income level and from every background have found ways to save money, become debt free, and save for retirement. It often takes great sacrifice, but freedom is never free.

## When can I retire?

Retirement is a financial state, not an age. However, in the American legal system, we have a few things that kick in at particular ages. Notable examples include:

- Social Security becomes available in your 60's. This won't enable you to retire with your much of a lifestyle (and for my generation, it may not be around at all when we get there), but it is income and that can help.

- "Retirement accounts" (401k, IRA, etc.) often incur penalties if you withdraw money from them before a certain age (around 60). Getting past that age opens those accounts up and enables you to access their income.

- Annuities and pensions may have age limits to start drawing income.

Note that these help, but don't automatically enable retirement: you might "retire" later. Also, there are other ways to achieve financial freedom outside of these mechanisms: you might be able to "retire" earlier. It all depends on how you save.

## How do I save? How much do I need to save?

I'm going to stand behind [Dave Ramsey's plan here](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps), and this particular question is dealt with in Baby Step 4. (Note that this means I'm assuming you're already debt free and have a little financial cushion; if not, do those earlier baby steps.) For most people, save 15% of your family income into stock mutual funds (see the 3-fund portfolio, coming soon). The various other factors you'll be balancing are 1) finishing the other baby steps, 2) saving, investing, and working longer, 3) trying to make more money to invest, and 4) adjusting your post-retirement lifestyle. With some combination of those, you'll make it.

The rule of thumb is to save an amount 10x your current income.

That may sound like a herculean task, but remember that money invested grows faster and faster over time. Consider that the stock market averages approximately 10% growth. Let's pull in the [Rule of 72](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp) to estimate a doubling time of about 7 years: that is, every 7 years, your investment doubles. If you invest 1x your income, in about 21 years (2x2x2), you'll have almost 10x your income _even if you don't invest anything more_. If you invest 1/2 your income, you'll need another 7 years to get to 10x, for a total of 28 years. Here's the point: if you get started early (in your 20's or 30's), you don't have to save very much to be able to retire. If you get started later, you can either save more, wait to retire for longer, or aim a little lower.

Saving more is awesome, and you're totally free to do that, but that's not primarily what we're discussing here.

## Diving deeper...

Saving for retirement shouldn't be scary... but unfortunately, it kinda is. There is so much legal mumbo jumbo surrounding this topic, on top of the usual complications that are the investment world. That said, for most people, you need to know just a handful of concepts, and then ignore all the other crap out there. These topics include:

- [What is a 401k/403b/IRA/TSP/etc.](retirement-vehicles)?

- [What is the difference between "Traditional" and "Roth"](roth-vs-traditional)?

- How should I allocate retirement investments?

- Retirement options to avoid.
