# What Is (and isn't) Investing

There are so many stigmas associated with the concept of investing.

- "Isn't that something rich people do?"
- "I invest in treasury bonds, the stock market's basically just gambling."
- "Oh yeah, I heard about a guy that invested in Bitcoin and made $\*\_!%# dollars and retired at 25!"
- "I wish I could invest, but I just don't make enough."
- "I'm not really sure about investing, but I save money into a high-yield savings account."

While I'll reign in my hopes for this introductory article, my hope is that you'll walk away from this site believing the following:

> Investing is something everyone can do safely and confidently, and anyone making an income to sustain themselves should be investing.

If that seems obvious to you, then I'm glad you're here. Check out my other articles and see if anything interests you.

If that seems like a bold, excessive, arrogant, "mansplaining", "richsplaining" statement, then please read on.

## Investing is Easy

Investing has never in the history of mankind been easier than it is today. By filling out a simple web form on Vanguard, or maybe your bank offers investments, or by getting on the phone with any investment firm, you can access affordable, reliable, trustworthy investments that are as good as what millionaires use. No background check, no laying up tens of thousands of dollars, no expensive monthly fees, no need to join a country club, no sleazy investment "advisors" that will steal your money.

I have a separate article that really walks you through this process step-by-step, or you can find others who will help you do the same anywhere online. You can even call up Vanguard and just ask them nicely to help you get started. I use Vanguard, but there are something like a dozen major firms that will offer you all the same services: good investments, easy access, trustworthy finances, low fees, quality service.

Once you have an investment account, you're free to do what you like... but again, if you're scared, it's easy to start simple. Check out my discussion of the [1-fund portfolio](the-1-fund-portfolio), where you can buy a single mutual fund and get a fully diversified, self-balancing investment portfolio. Throw money in and let it handle itself for the rest of your life. It really can be that simple if you want.

(No disclaimer needed. I make no commission from Vanguard or any other firm. I have no financial interest in any such firm. I'm just here to help demystify your options.)

## (Diversified) Investing is Safe

Investing can be safe, though you do have to avoid taking the "wisdom" of gurus and journalists who will try to tell you what to do with your money each week. Investing is like grilling a good hamburger: put it on the grill, and leave it the f^@# alone.

If you get financial news, you may encounter a flurry of "This stock is at an all time low: buy! buy! buy!" or "If you'd followed our advice to buy Apple 10 years ago, here's how much you'd have now!" and crap like that. **This is complete and utter crap.** Research has shown time and again that predicting the market is a fool's game. Trying to out-think the system is gambling; sure, there are winners, but you won't be one of them. And no, the people offering this advice haven't beat the system either, no matter what they tell you.

Here's the reality: buying good, diversified investment portfolios (meaning, for example, a stock index fund spread across hundreds or thousands of companies) and holding them for long periods of time is the most surefire way to make the best returns. And doing this isn't hard or expensive: at any major investment firm, you can generally find a single mutual fund that will spread your money over the entire stock market, and it'll cost you next to nothing. Again, I reference such funds in [the 1-fund portfolio](the-1-fund-portfolio) and [the 3-fund portfolio](the-3-fund-portfolio).

This isn't gambling.

You might've run into someone who got into the stock market and lost everything. What happened was they tried to out-think the market by buying individual stocks... Apple, Microsoft, IBM (remember them?), Xerox, whatever seemed like the next big thing at the time. If the company goes bankrupt, you can get stuck holding stock that's worth nothing.

In contrast to that, having diversified portfolios balances those high returns (Apple really did go _wayyy_ up at one point) against those high risks (remember when AOL was the next big thing?). The result is that, if you got an S&P 500 index fund (basically the 500 biggest US companies) and just let your money sit, you'd average an 8-10% return over the long haul.

Now, some years are up and some years are down, to the tune of -10% up to +30% (you'll land somewhere between those two values in 80% of all years... and that includes the Great Depression). There's some risk, so you definitely want to be taking a long-term view for the money you invest; don't invest any money you expect to need in the next couple years.

You're guaranteed, on average, to lose the lottery. You're guaranteed, on average, to lose at the casino. You're statistically unlikely to win by picking individual stocks. But if you invest in broad mutual funds and let the money sit for a few years, you're virtually guaranteed to make money.

It's not exciting, it's not a roller coaster ride, you won't become a millionaire overnight. But you _will_ become a millionaire if you invest with any seriousness and can wait long enough.

## Investing is for Everyone

I have a separate set of articles about personal finances (coming soon), but here's a fact: on average, your net worth (the sum total of everything you own minus everything you owe) can either be going down, going nowhere, or going up.

If your net worth is going down or is a flat line... well, there's not really a tactful way to put it. Think about that for a second, and if you're scared by what you see, [then know that there's hope](https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/blog/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps/). Start by resolving that.

Did you read what I just linked? No? Go read it first. Investing is a life-changing thing and it really is for everyone, but it needs to belong in its proper context. So go read [that article](https://www.clevergirlfinance.com/blog/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps/) and come back here when you understand it.

Ok, you've paid off your debt and saved an emergency fund--and if you still don't believe that that's possible for you, [please hear the stories of the millions of people who won with money starting from where you're at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_8ebac0ZWc). And now you're financially stable, and you have the income stream that you used to pay off debt (or, barring that, you have the money you're not paying as interest anymore). Your net worth is on a positive trajectory, but what do you do with that?

Investing is about setting aside cash and income that you can do without for now so that you have more later. By effectively loaning that money to others, it'll accrue passive income for you, which you can then loan out to others, to accrue more income, to loan out to others... until eventually you have [many, many times more money than you started with](the-power-of-compound-growth).

It's not about becoming filthy rich. You don't have to want to live in a mansion, or to drive a Lamborghini, or to fly a private helicopter onto a private yacht. Investing is about putting money to work in your stead. By investing money and making an income from it, you can slowly replace your own income until [you no longer _need_ to work](retirement-investing). You _can_ still work at that point if you want, but it'll be your choice rather than slavery to the paycheck. But the reality is that you won't always be _able_ to work for a living, and saving up for that day is what's necessary and responsible in our society; certainly, the government doesn't owe you a nice retirement, and you're a fool if you think you're going to kick back into a comfortable life on a Social Security check. (If your kids have already offered to take care of you until your dying day, they've demonstrated the capacity to do so, and you trust them that much, then good on you... but that's not most people, and even then, I'm sure being able to chip in for your needs would be welcome.)

And what about investing beyond or outside of retirement? Well shoot, if you invest and, by the power of [compounding interest](the-power-of-compound-growth), you end up with a million dollars that you don't want or need for some reason... do you think maybe you could figure out _something_ nice to do with it? Maybe support a charity? Travel the world? Fund your kids' college a dozen times over?

Investing isn't about becoming the next Bill Gates, it's about taking control of your life--and that's something everyone should want to do. Whether it's to provide for your own needs when your body or mind start weakening or simply to pursue a world beyond what your weekly paycheck can enable, investing is about improving the future at some cost to the present. Just like going to school, getting a degree, or raising children.

## Diving Deeper

So don't be scared. Investing does take a little knowledge, but nothing very technical nor very deep. It's something anyone can learn to do: it's something you can learn to do.

If you're aiming for retirement, consider starting with [my article on that topic](retirement-investing).

If you want to get into the nitty-gritty details and actually start doing this stuff today, check out my simple investing series (coming soon).

If you like the math'y side of this and want to go beyond the basics, or learn about what the pro's do (hedge funds and crap like that), I've got stuff for you too (coming soon). Totally optional, I don't think this is a domain that's profitable for most people (personally or financially).
