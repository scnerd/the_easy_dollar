# The 1-Fund Portfolio

Maybe you've read about [the 3-fund portfolio](the-3-fund-portfolio), or maybe you just really want investing to be very simple. It really can be simple. It can be safe (not to say, non-volatile). There really can be "set it and forget it" approaches to financial independence. Here are three routes to go:

## If you're investing for retirement

If you're just aiming for retirement ([or whatever you want to call "being financially free"](retirement-investing)), there are often funds just for you. These are called "Target Date Funds" or "Target Retirement Funds", and handle basically all the complexity for you. They'll grow rapidly when you're far from retirement, then settle down a bit and make sure that, as you near retirement, your money keeps growing with minimal risk of it losing value.

[Here's Vanguard's article on the topic](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/), but you can find comparable funds through any major investment firm.

Keeping to my theme of "explaining the _why_, not telling you _what_", this topic deserves an explanation for how these funds work under the hood and why that's good for you.

All these funds do is internally implement the strategies I discuss in my articles on allocations and rebalancing (coming soon), [mutual fund balancing](what-are-stocks-and-bonds), and what's lightly summarized in the discussion of [the 3-fund portfolio](the-3-fund-portfolio).

In short, different investment vehicles have different behaviors which provide different advantages. Balancing these advantages against each other allows you to maximize your investment returns ("while managing risk", but I dislike that phrase...).

The best way to balance these advantages depends on your risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. If you're aiming to maximize growth over 30 years, you'll want to invest differently than if you'll need a steady income next year. These Target Date Funds are built on top of other well-diversified investments, and it shifts its allocation across these investments as you get closer to the target date in order to ensure maximum growth earlier and maximum stability later.

There is no "one size fits all" investment strategy, but if you're investing for retirement and want to be as hands-off as possible, it's hard to do better than putting your money into an appropriate Target Date Fund.

## If you're investing for a particular risk tolerance

What if you are investing money, but it's not for retirement? or you're already in retirement? or you just want to say "grow" or "make steady income"?

In the past, you would have had to pick the assets yourself and look at historical data to figure out how to achieve your goal. Today? You can just invest in a fund that targets the risk/reward balance you want.

[Vanguard offers this as "Life Strategy" funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy/#/). I expect you can find equivalents at other major investment firms. There may also be other combine Growth and Income funds to provide a balance close to whatever you want, though this can take a bit more digging to find. If none of those are available, you can mimic the stock/bond allocations they show on this page using [the funds listed in the 3-fund portfolio](the-3-fund-portfolio), which _are_ available essentially everywhere.

## Picking a single fund

Even outside of funds dedicated to particular risk/reward tradeoffs, you can often find funds that target almost any stock/bond allocation. For most general investing, trading off risk and reward boils down to balancing how much you're invested in stocks versus bonds. In both cases, you want to be as diversified as possible (invested in as much of the stock or bond market as possible).

Recall that there is [very little difference between most stock/bond ratios](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/model-portfolio-allocation), so I'll lump them into four categories.

**For aggressive growth** (75%+ stocks, 8-10% return), you can pick the broadest stock index you can find. A great example of this is [Vanguard's Total World stock index](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTWSX). It tracks essentially every stock in the world. Boom, diversification.

**For conservative growth** (50-75% stocks, ~8% return), you can pick a balanced stock-heavy index fund. Finding 60/40 funds is pretty easy; [for example, this one](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vbiax).

**For balanced income** (25-50% stocks, 6-8% return), many income funds fall somewhere in here, often aiming for anywhere between 20/80 and 40/60. [Here's a popular 40/60 income fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vwinx).

**For conservative income** (25%- stocks, 3-6% return), you're probably just looking at a [broad bond index fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/portfolio/vbtlx). Nothing fancy.

Note that even bonds have some volatility, so even the "conservative income" path isn't 0-risk, just a low-risk one. For effectively 0-risk look into Money Market funds, which have correspondingly effectively 0 return. They're basically glorified savings accounts, but on occasion their interest rises to semi-rational levels. Don't expect them to ever do more than keep up with inflation, though, if that.
