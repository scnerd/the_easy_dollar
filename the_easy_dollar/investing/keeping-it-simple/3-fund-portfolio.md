# The 3-Fund Portfolio

Alright, you're ready to invest some money. You open an investment account, either a retirement account or a... I dunno what to call it, a non-retirement account? A liquid account? A brokerage account? Just, "investments"? Whatever. You are able to buy investments. Which ones do you buy?

If you're looking for the quick answer, I'll give you two options.

- [The Bogleheads community recommends the following three](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio):
    - Total (US) stock market index fund
    - Total international stock market index fund
    - Total bond market index fund
- [Ramsey recommends the following four](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/how-to-invest-in-mutual-funds) (sorry, I cheated):
    - Growth
    - Growth & Income
    - Aggressive Growth
    - International

First off, these aren't specific mutual funds, they're descriptions. That said, no matter which investment firm you're going through, you can probably find a small number of offerings that match each of the above descriptions.

Second, how much to put into each fund? While the two articles I link offer specific allocations, I'm going to walk you through _why_ those are good allocations.

## Basic Diversification

Before anything else, make sure to read the primer on investment allocation and rebalancing (coming soon). You may also benefit from the discussion of [what are stocks, bonds, and mutual funds](what-are-stocks-and-bonds). These two articles introduce you to the most common investment vehicles, stocks and bonds, how they act in general, and how you can combine them into a diverse portfolio easily using broad mutual funds.

Ok. So you know what stocks and bonds are, and you know that stocks have higher returns and higher volatility, and that bonds have lower returns and lower volatility. (Note that all generalizations like those are "historical", there's at least a century of data to back up those statements.) You also know that stocks, being tiny pieces of ownership in companies, can either represent US companies or international companies. Is that a US-centric way of looking at things? Totally. But if you're a US investor, that's the world you live in.

For maximum growth, accepting moderate volatility, you'll want most of your money in stocks, and most of that in US stocks. How much is "most"? [Here's a comparison from Vanguard for specific percentage](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/model-portfolio-allocation). Allow me to generalize for a moment: their 70% stock average return is 9.4%, and their 100% return is 10.2%. A the end of the day, it hardly matters which of those you get. Pick whatever makes you happier, you'll get ~10% returns.

I'll note here that you'll often hear investment advisors recommend a shift toward "mostly" bonds as you near retirement. They recommend this to reduce volatility and ensure that, when you hit "retirement age", you'll have as much money as you expect. This is fine advice, and probably the right decision for most people. Whether or not that's what _you_ do is up to you. I'm nowhere near the point of making that decision yet, but I expect to have enough investment growth at that point that I'll probably keep the higher returns and higher volatility, and use other mechanisms to make sure I don't withdraw money during bad years.

## Picking Specific Funds

But the funds I listed above weren't specific investment funds, just vague descriptions. How do you actually find and pick the specific investments given what's available to you?

- [The Bogleheads article](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) gives some specific funds for what they discuss. I'm sure there are plenty of other similar articles.
- Look through the list of available funds for funds that have "growth", "growth and income", "international", "total", and other keywords. It generally is that simple. [Here's a list of Vanguard's best funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/select-funds/asset-class/month-end-returns) ([or all of them](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/mutual-funds/asset-class/month-end-returns)), you'll see what I mean. While you're at it, look at the 10 year returns for each fund, or use their fund comparison tool to look at the "growth of $5,000" over 10 years to get a gist for how different funds produce different returns _and_ volatilities. See if you can find funds that don't track exactly with each other.
- Use a robo-advisor. At least with Vanguard, their self-managing portfolio service will basically just drop you in a small collection of funds much like this 3-fund portfolio.
- Hire a human advisor. (If you take this approach, make sure you hire someone with a flat fee rather than an ongoing "management fee".) [Here's a Ramsey article about how to find such a person](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/retirement/how-to-hire-a-financial-advisor) (they also advertise for, and vet, financial advisors), but you can find these services nearly anywhere. Just be very, very careful who you choose and who you trust, this is a prime field for fraud.

## Can't this be simpler?

Yes. Yes it can. If you don't want to worry about allocations, stock/bond balance ratios, and crap like that, you can go with a simple 1-fund portfolio and choose something that will perform that balancing for you. (Coming soon)
