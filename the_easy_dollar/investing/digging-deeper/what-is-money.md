# What is Money?

What is money? Isn't it the dollar bills in your wallet? Or the number in your bank balance? I mean, I guess different countries have different monies, and then there's that weird cryptocurrency thing... but basically, money is just something that's worth something else, right?

## Economic Theory

This site isn't a full lesson in economics. My goal is to help you understand what's going on in the financial world so you're comfortable swimming in it. The problem is, the pool we're all swimming in has been carefully crafted and shaped by various people who want to control it, creating a minefield of difficult terms and loopholes within loopholes. That means that, without some basic, sane economic theory, we're swept around with the currents and have no basis upon which to understand it all.

If you're able to invest a bit more time into understanding economics, I cannot recommend enough Economics In One Lesson ([free PDF](https://fee.org/media/14946/economicsinonelesson.pdf), [free print book](https://mises.org/forms/get-your-free-economics-one-lesson-book)) as a very short introduction to this topic. If you're willing to invest a little more time, The Creature From Jekyll Island (either [the simplified Tuttle Twins version](https://www.amazon.com/Tuttle-Twins-Creature-Jekyll-Island/dp/1943521026), or [the original beefy version](https://www.amazon.com/Creature-Jekyll-Island-Federal-Reserve/dp/091298645X/ref=sr_1_2)) goes into greater depth and focuses on demystifying today's convoluted financial system.

In short, however, economics thinks in terms of goods, to which people ascribe value. "Value" is represented by what I would be willing to give up in order to get something else.

### How to buy a cow

I have a cow. You have a bunch of sheep. You want a cow. How do you get it?

Answer: offer to trade me some sheep for my cow.

How many sheep? I don't know. I'll say five, since cows give milk every day and sheep only give wool occasionally, which I'll now need to sell to buy milk.

"Five?!?" You stifle a shout. "I'll offer two. Sheep give wool plenty often to make up for the milk."

"Four," I counter.

"Three, no more."

"Three it is."

I now have three sheep, and you have a cow and three fewer sheep than before.

### The Sheep Standard is inconvenient

The next day, you buy a plow for two sheep. When you tell me about it, I let you know that I would've gladly traded my cow for a plow.

But wait a minute... if I would've traded my cow for a plow, but wanted at least three sheep for it, when the other guy only wanted two sheep for a plow... don't you feel ripped off?

Buy hey, you lived halfway between me and the guy with the plow. It would've been a pain to sell my cow to him. That's a long way to carry a plow. Besides, I think a plow for a cow is a bad deal for me, but I can't ask for one and a half plows (the equivalent of three sheep), now can I?

This would be really nice if we could trade something that wasn't sheep. Something without legs and a mind of its own. Something easier to divide into piece. Something easily portable. Something everybody wants, or at least enough people want that you _know_ you can trade it for something you want. Something that won't get sick and die tomorrow.

### Inventing the Wheat Standard

So the next day, you come to me with wheat. Once it's properly treated, it'll last a long time, everyone needs it, it's easy to weigh out exactly how much each person wants, it's easy to transport in sacks.

Let's say you're able to sell your sheep for a giant sack of wheat. Next time you want a cow, you come to me and offer me three sacks of wheat. That's basically as good as three sheep, in fact it's better because it's more likely I can trade the wheat for what I want. So voila, you sell several sheep to the wheat farmer, sell three sacks of wheat to me for a cow, and I can sell two sacks of that to the third guy for his plow. Everyone's happy.

But look at the wheat. Sure, the third guy finally grinds it up and turns it into bread. In fact, if I sold you a cow for three sacks and bought a plow for two, I still have a sack lying around, so I'm making bread too. So eventually, the wheat turns into a consumable good. Until then, though, it serves as a medium of exchange: that is, it is the stuff that facilitates exchanges occurring. You didn't want the wheat, I didn't especially want it, but both of us accepted it in trade for our stuff because we knew we could sell it to the next guy for what we actually wanted.

### Upgrading to the Gold Standard

Replace wheat with gold, and voila, we've just summarized how money came into existence. Gold is better than wheat because it's much more compact and not prone to decay. Eventually, someone will turn it into jewelry--or, in the modern day, electronics--and the gold converts from being something everyone will take in trade into being a useful commodity. So it remains useful, and enough people will accept it that it's liquid--that is, _someone_ will trade the things you actually want in exchange for gold--and thus we get "money".

Money isn't it's own kind of thing, it's just a label for whatever kind of stuff is most convenient for facilitating trade. In some societies, sea shells served that role; in others, shark's teeth; in others, silver or tin; in others, cigarettes. "Money" is just a term used to describe whatever commonly valued thing is most convenient in a certain society for facilitating the exchange of other goods. The term has nothing inherently to do with dollar bills... so where do dollar bills come from?

### What's lighter than gold, but just as valuable?

Gold's great and all, but it's really heavy. Finding something that's more valuable per unit of weight is pretty tough. Also, having a bunch of gold lying around is pretty conspicuous and just begging someone to steal it.

Fortunately, you've got a friend named Smith. Smith has a giant vault for storing lots of other valuable equipment. You trust him implicitly, and think that his vault would be a much safer place for your gold to live than under your bed. So you call him up one day and say "Hey, could you chuck my gold into a spare corner of your vault?"

Smith agrees, and the following day takes your gold and secures it in his vault. In exchange, he gives you a couple slips of paper, one for each ounce of gold you gave him.

Each piece of paper says "Return this slip to Smith to exchange for an ounce of gold." His signature is on the bottom, legally binding him to honor the bill. Now, anytime you need to trade with someone who knows and trusts Smith, you can give them one of these bills instead of raw gold, since they know it's just as good as gold.

In exchange for his services, Smith charges you a small fee, say one ounce of gold per year. For the convenience of not having to haul around pounds of gold, it seems a small price to pay.

Now I wave my hands and say "we deal with counterfeiting, lost bills, different denominations, auditing the vault, etc. etc. etc." There are a lot of practical considerations, and at the end of the day you'll need a really trustworthy, reputable vault owner for this kind of thing to work out; but work it does, and almost exactly this kind of system was the foundation for paper money for a long time.

### If no one ever converts the bills to gold, will they care if they can't?

Inevitably, the government ends up stepping in and taking the role of the "most reputable vault owner." Maybe they do so by force (outlawing private vaults), maybe they simply push out the competition since they can pay for operating expenses with taxes. Either way, it's very common that you end up with a national or regional monetary system based on who runs the local vault.

But at some point, once the money has achieved circulation and trust, people stop asking for their gold back. Why would they? The paper bills are just as good, and much more convenient. And eventually, someone in charge asks, "why do we even need there to be gold?"

You see, binding the vault to only issuing bills for gold it actually has is limiting. What if you want to pay for a war? On the gold standard, you either have to have the physical gold, sitting right there, ready to pay people with, or people trust you to win enough that they'll loan you gold and expect you to pay it back. But if there is no gold, if there's only paper that people will accept as if it were valuable (because they can exchange it for actually valuable goods), then you can just print more money. Voila, the government now has more money, pays for the war, and carries on with life. There are also numerous economic adjustments the government can cause if it can arbitrarily cause money to pop in and out of existence.

So the state treasury system, which runs the vault, declares that bills will no longer be exchangeable for gold. The bills are _themselves_ money, no longer mere proxies for money (remembering that the gold was always the real money, the paper just stood in its place for the physical exchange of goods).

Of course, this couldn't last long all by itself. What if I don't trust the government? What if I want to take my wealth somewhere else? Basically, what if I want _real_ money that will work in a context where the government has no sway? The paper becomes meaningless, and eventually this sentiment ripples out through the economy. Unless people are forced to accept the meaningless slips of paper, they'll revert to exchanging via something that's actually valuable... like, oh say, gold.

What's the solution? The government wanted to be free of needing gold to pay for things, but people will naturally only want to exchange their valuable goods for _other valuable goods_. Paper, which the government can make more of anytime it wishes, simply doesn't cut the mustard anymore. So instead of sticking to honest money, the government does the one thing it's good at: it passes and enforces laws.

"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private."

Sound familiar? If you pull out a dollar bill, you'll find it printed on the front. This is the government's promise... and its threat. "Legal tender" just means "state-supported value". In other words, "The bill is something that has value, and you had better treat is as such... or else."

The "for all debts, public and private" means that this bill must be accepted as payment for any situation where money is owed. "Public" means you can use it to pay your taxes. "Private" means you can use it--and _must_ accept it--for any private exchange. So if I put my computer up on eBay and ask for 1 ounce of gold in exchange (if that were possible), then you can come along and say "I don't have an ounce of gold, but I have 1,500 of the $1 pieces of paper." If that's the price of 1 ounce of gold, then legally I can't reject your offer on the grounds of not wanting meaningless paper. I may not trust the US dollar, but that doesn't matter; if I refuse your offer of payment, you can take me to court and say that I'm refusing to accept the "legal tender". I'll get fined, you'll get to make your purchase, and the government enforces its policy that I must treat this paper like it has value, whether or not I want to.

**This is called "fiat money"**. It's "money" because it's something of "value" that's ubiquitously useful for exchange. It's "fiat" (from the Latin word "to say") because it only holds that status because the government says so.

### Lots of other things can be "money"

Look, I'm grouchy about fiat money... and I'm not alone. See [FEE](https://fee.org/), the [Mises Institute](https://mises.org/), or books like [The Creature from Jekyll Island](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ARFNQ54). This is a major point of contention between Austrian Economics (which promotes honest, fair trade governed by market forces) and Keynesian Economics (which promotes a controlled economy governed by central planners).

But that said, in this day and age, the strangle hold of centralized fiat currencies finally has some cracks showing. Cryptocurrency is a major part of that discussion, but I'll keep that conversation in a separate article. The point I want to make here is that people are starting to wake up again to the idea that other things can be used for trade besides the single government-sanctioned fiat currency. Want to buy a pizza in exchange for Bitcoin? Want to buy cloud storage with Filecoin? That's possible now. And maybe, with the resurrection of some gold-backed currencies, we'll find once again that we can use real money in today's economy and not need to bow the knee to central banks.

But more on that another time.
