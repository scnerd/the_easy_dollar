# The True Cost of Taxes

Most taxes are imposed on exchanges: income, purchases, investment returns, inheritance, gifts, etc.
This imposes friction on transactions between people and discourages those interactions, since the more you interact, the less money is left in circulation.
Let's look at an example.

Let's say you want to buy something worth $100.
This could be groceries, a date night out, a piece of art, a phone, whatever.
For simplicity, let's say it's a piece of art.
You get your paycheck, walk into an art store, buy your piece, and take it home.
Let's follow the money and see where it went.

For the sake of argument, let's work with some typical numbers:
- About a third (33%) of your gross income goes to income-related taxes, unless you make very little (<\$50,000) or a lot (>\$300,000).
- Sales tax is often around 7%.
- Let's use a 70/30% split for artist vs. store. Different industries use different splits, but the exact amount won't matter much for this discussion.
- Of a retail store's overhead, about ~15% goes to payroll.

With these numbers, we're equipped to do some back-of-the-napkin math. I'm going to round everything to the nearest dollar for simplicity.

Your \$100 of net income cost your employer \$150 of wages. We'll ignore other employment overhead. So, to start with, we're talking about \$150 of gross revenue you earned in exchange for your time and skills. \$50 of that vanished into taxes before you even saw it, leaving \$100 in your bank account to spend.

You spend \$100 at the store. In the US, we typically don't include sales tax in the "price" of something, but for simplicity let's say your out-the-door cost was \$100. This means the pre-tax price of the art was about \$93, and \$7 went to sales tax.

Of that \$93, 70% went to the artist and 30% went to the store. The artist's gross income is thus \$65, which then has \$22 of taxes removed, leaving the artist with \$43 to spend. The store makes \$28, of which \$4 goes to payroll (of which \$1 goes to taxes and \$3 goes to individuals), with the remaining \$24 going to overhead and maybe a couple dollars of profit, both of which of course continue down a chain of further taxation.

Let's summarize all of that:
- Your time and skill were worth \$150
- That gave you \$100 of purchasing power
- You made a single purchase of a single item
- The time and skills of the artist was valued at \$65, leaving them with \$43 of purchasing power
- The time and skills of the store employees was valued at \$4, which left them with \$3 of purchasing power
- Only \$24 goes is unaccounted for above and is part of the chain of store overhead, which follows a similar path
- In total, at least \$80 went to the government in taxes, besides what will be taxed of the remaining \$24

So while the taxation rates are 33% for income and 7% for sales, when that's chained across multiple transactions, those values only describe single-transaction taxes.
When we look at two or three transactions (you earning money and then also spending it), quite quickly that rises to $ \$80 / \$150 = 53% $ going to taxes and only \$70 or 47% of that value remaining in circulation.
By the time you've earned and spent your money, the government has taken more of it than everyone else combined.

In short, when considering taxes on exchanges (income and sales being the most common kinds), you need to think about the effect this has on circulation and how this effectively limits how far money can travel before it all ends up back in the government's hands.

There are other kinds of taxes that aren't exchange-based, including property taxes and [inflation](the-federal-reserve). We'll explore the impact of these elsewhere.
